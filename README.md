Julia and Kate want to convert dog ags to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study
Create a function 'calcAveragehumanAge, which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ['ages'], and does the following things in order:

1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge=2 x dogage, if the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge x 4
2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years odl (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs
4. Run the function for both test datasets
